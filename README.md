__Text-based vending machine simulator in Java, using local storage__

*Created by Alex Kaehler*

For our first bootcamp project, the goal was to become comfortable with creating an actual application, even a simple one. This required the use of multiple classes and the use of OOP principals such as encapsulation and abstraction, as well as core Java skills like loops, conditional logic, objects, string manipulation, and I/O.

The simulator gives the user a starting amount of money, after which they can view, choose, and purchase items. Change is calculated, and the list of items and quantities is stored in a local text file.
